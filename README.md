# Milestones
## Description
"Milestones" is a project that presents a timeline of personal events, offering various filters like "professional," "achievement," and "personal" to categorize different aspects of one's life. It serves as a platform for individuals to showcase their story through significant milestones such as career accomplishments, educational pursuits, life-changing experiences like relocations or marriages, and more. 

Stretch Goal: Users can selectively share specific filters, allowing friends, recruiters and others to gain insights into their unique journey and understand who they are on a deeper level.
